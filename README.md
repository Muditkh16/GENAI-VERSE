# Social App Demo

This is a toy project to demonstrate class relationships and flows.

- `models/`: Core entities like User, Post, Comment
- `services/`: Business logic (AuthService, PostService)
- `controllers/`: Orchestration layer (UserController, PostController)
- `utils/`: Utility classes (Logger)

Run `main.py` to simulate a small social network interaction.
